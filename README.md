# Basic TicTacToe
Written in Javascript and p5.js, this is the fun classic game we all know and love - TicTacToe.

At this moment in time, it is only client side and you need someone else to play with you, but if I have time I may implement an AI or websockets for multiplayer later on.

### Try it out!
To try out, first clone the repository with:
```bash
	$ git clone https://github.com/OliverCordingl1/TicTacToe.git/
	$ cd TicTacToe/
	$ open index.html
```

You should now be able to play the game.
**NOTE:** *If the `open` command did not work for you, open the `index.html` in your web browser of choice*
